Research is a tool for building knowledge and for facilitating learning. It plays a pivotal role in making universities competitive worldwide. Quality research enables universities to explore organizational and societal issues to identify or suggest solutions. It enables the educational sector to perform the systematic analysis while continuously improving our practices, thus develops refined understanding related to learning and teaching.

The project is part of CS 5150 Course and is Developed for the Students, Teachers and Staff to manage their Research Works and find guidance and resources for delivering high-quality research projects.

The application manages the record of all current and previous researches in the department providing easy basis for teachers to go through the already conducted researches and continue working from the point where it was left previously.
An additional feature called Research Paper Tracker enables students to maintain notes of research papers they have studied so far and read reviews done by other students.
